This project implements a Research Paper Question-Answering (QA) chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). 
It allows users to ask questions about research papers and receive accurate, context-aware answers. 

Key features:
- PDF/Document loader for research papers
- Embedding generation for efficient retrieval
- RAG pipeline for context-based answer generation
- Modular design for easy extension to new datasets or models

The project is designed for researchers and AI enthusiasts to explore QA over academic literature with modern NLP techniques.
